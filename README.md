ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone! Great job building your chatbots last session. They used a lot of strings â€” but what happens when Python deals with numbers or True/False questions?

This week weâ€™re exploring Python Data Types â€” the building blocks of how your program understands and handles different kinds of information.ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn:
â€¢ The 4 core data types in Python:
  âž¤ str (String)
  âž¤ int (Integer)
  âž¤ float (Decimal Numbers)
  âž¤ bool (Boolean: True or False)

â€¢ How to use type() to check what kind of data you're working with
â€¢ How to convert between types using int(), float(), and str()ðŸ“Œ This Weekâ€™s Assignment: Python Data Types

ðŸŽ¯ Your Goal:
Show that you understand the four main data types in Python by creating and displaying each one â€” clearly and correctly.

ðŸ”§ What To Do:
1. Create four variables, each using a different data type:
  âž¤ One string
  âž¤ One integer
  âž¤ One float
  âž¤ One boolean
2. Use the print() function to display the value of each variable.
3. Use the type() function to display the data type of each variable.
4. Add comments to explain each line of your code so itâ€™s easy to understand.


âœ… To complete this assignment:
    â€¢ Include 4 variables, each using a different data type
    â€¢ Make sure your code runs without errors
    â€¢ Add comments explaining your code
    â€¢ Take a screenshot of your working program (both code and output)
